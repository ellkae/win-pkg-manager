Windows Package Manager

The main goal of this application is to meet the needs of the Western Washington University -
Computer Science department. However, the design kept general purpose use in mind.

The `winpkg` CLI frontend was inspired by FreeBSD's portsnap & portupgrade suite, and those
familiar with the latter may recognize most of the flags and equivalent functionalities.
